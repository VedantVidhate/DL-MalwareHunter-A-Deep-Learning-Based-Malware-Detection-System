# Deep Learning Project for Malware Detection

This repository contains the code and data used for building a deep learning model for malware detection. The project aims to classify malware data using a deep learning approach, leveraging tools such as Python, Pandas, and PyTorch.

## Project Structure

- `Project_DL.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook with all the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for the project.
- `models/`: Saved deep learning models (if applicable).
- `scripts/`: Additional Python scripts for data processing or model inference (if applicable).

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains 100,000 entries, each representing a malware sample with multiple features. These features include:

- `hash`: Unique identifier for each sample.
- `millisecond`: Time-related feature.
- `classification`: Indicates whether the sample is classified as malware or not.
- Various system-level features such as `state`, `usage_counter`, `prio`, etc.

## Model

The model used in this project is a deep neural network implemented using PyTorch. The steps involved in building the model include:

1. Data loading and preprocessing.
2. Model architecture definition.
3. Training the model using the training dataset.
4. Evaluating the model's performance on the test dataset.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/malware-detection.git
   cd malware-detection
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter notebook to preprocess the data and train the model:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Project_DL.ipynb
   ```

## Results

The model's performance is evaluated using common metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results are visualized using confusion matrices and other charts.
